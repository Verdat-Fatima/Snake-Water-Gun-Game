# Snake-Water-Gun-Game
This is a simple Python project that I created as my first mini-game in Python. It is a console-based version of the classic “Snake, Water, Gun” game where the user plays against the computer. The user can choose Snake (s), Water (w), or Gun (g), and the computer randomly makes its choice. The rules are simple: Snake drinks Water, Water drowns Gun, and Gun kills Snake. If both the user and computer choose the same option, the game is a draw. The project helped me practice important Python concepts such as dictionaries, the random module, conditionals, and input validation. In the future, I plan to improve it by adding a replay option, keeping score across multiple rounds, organizing the code into functions, and maybe even creating a graphical version using Tkinter or Pygame.
